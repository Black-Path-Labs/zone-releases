# Installs the `zone` client: downloads the release binary for this OS and CPU with its
# SHA256SUMS, checks the signature of SHA256SUMS against the release key (with cosign, or with
# openssl when cosign is not installed) and the binary's sum, and puts it in ~/.local/bin/zone.
# It never uses sudo.

#
# Download it first, as above, rather than piping curl into sh: when the download fails, a pipe
# hands sh nothing and the install "succeeds" with exit 0. This script exits non-zero, saying
# which file is missing, when the release or a file in it is not found.
#
# ZONE_INSTALL_DIR replaces ~/.local/bin. ZONE_GH=1 downloads with `gh release download`, which
# also reaches a private repository or a draft release with gh's login. An unsigned release is
# refused unless ZONE_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1. ZONE_COSIGN_PUB replaces the release key (tests).
